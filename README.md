# City-Map-Navigation
CityMap is a Java-based program that simulates a cityâ€™s road map using graph data structures. The system allows users to manage intersections and roads interactively, supporting operations like adding/removing intersections, checking for paths between points, and listing all reachable intersections from a given location.
