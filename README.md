# City-Map-Navigation

## Project Overview
CityMap is a Java application that simulates a city map using graph data structures. It allows users to add and remove intersections and roads, view the map, check connectivity between intersections, and explore reachable areas.

## Features
- Add or remove intersections (nodes)
- Add or remove roads (edges) with customizable weights.
- View the current map with all connections.
- Check if a path exists between two intersections.
- List all reachable intersections from a given starting point.
- Supports both directed and undirected graphs (default is undirected).

## Concepts Used
- HashMap for graph representation.
- Depth-First Search for pathfinding and reachability.
- Encapsulation of Edge class.
- Interactive menu-driven interface.
- Clean input handling with validation.
